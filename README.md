**Title**: Development of Localized IoT Microweather Stations for Baseline Meteorological Parameters in Naga City <br/>
<br/>
**Abstract**:
This study will develop localized IoT-enabled microweather stations that will provide data on seven meteorological parameters, namely temperature, humidity, rainfall, barometric pressure, wind speed, wind direction, and light intensity. The increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events pose significant challenges to Naga City, Camarines Sur, and the broader Bicol Region. Existing weather monitoring systems, such as those managed by the Philippine, Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), provide regional data but often lack the localization needed for decision-making of various sectors. The proposed system will integrate high-precision sensors with a Heltec WiFi LoRa V3 microcontroller to process and transmit data via Wi-Fi, LoRa, or GSM to a server or cloud platform. A power management system will also be designed using solar energy. Measurements will be visualized through a user-friendly interface to provide baseline data that could support decision-making regarding disaster preparedness, urban planning, agriculture, and other sectors.  <br/>
