**Title**: Development of Localized IoT Microweather Stations for Baseline Meteorological Parameters in Naga City <br/>
<br/>
**Abstract**:
This study developed and deployed localized IoT-enabled microweather stations to address the lack of local weather data in Naga City, Camarines Sur, and the broader Bicol Region. Each station measured six meteorological parameters, including temperature, humidity, rainfall, barometric pressure, wind speed, and wind direction, using high-precision sensors integrated with a Heltec WiFi LoRa V3 microcontroller. Data were transmitted via Wi-Fi, LoRa, or GSM to the ThingSpeak IoT platform for real-time storage and visualization, with local SD card backups. Powered by solar energy and visualized through a custom-built website, the system offered accessible, real-time environmental monitoring. Field validation and deployment confirmed continuous and efficient data acquisition. The microweather stations successfully captured localized variations in temperature, humidity, rainfall, pressure, and wind patterns across different sites. By providing real-time, site-specific weather information, the system aims to aid future disaster risk management, urban planning, agricultural decision-making, and academic research. Overall, the project demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the IoT microweather stations in gathering valuable local weather data.
